The set of scripts in this folder were developed to infer recombination breakpoints from hundreds of single sperm cells, 
each sequenced at very low coverage, and the corresponding high coverage (>15x) WGS of the donor. 

The bulk of single sperm cells is used both to phase the parental genome and infer the recombination breakpoints of each single
cell. The WGS of the donor is required to know with confidence the set of heterozygous sites per chromosome to be phased by 
using the (haploid) sperm cells. 


The inference of recombination breakpoints from SC involves three steps:

1) generating input files (GT output files from vcftools)

2) running the phasing of parental chromosomes from the multiple SCs (longest part)

3) comparing the phased parental chromosomes with each single cell (rough estimation no HMM)

4) running an HMM model to identify the breakpoints by taking into account error rates
